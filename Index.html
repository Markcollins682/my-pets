        <h1>MY FAVOURITE PET</h1>
        <P>The pet I love most is my snake, it's a black Anaconda that I imported from the Eastern side of the Amazon</P>
        <p>Despite that, I have to say I also like my monkey almost equally, imported from a private zoo in the U.S, it is trained to almost do everything like a human being</p>
        <p>I want to conclude by saying, there also are a couple of animals that I don't like, these include cats, dogs and such likes, I think they're very common pets and one needs a change like what I have. Thank you!</p>
